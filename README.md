# Dark Magician Staff

## About

The model was built using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), exported as a `.stl` file, imported into [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/), sliced and the result is saved as a `.gcode` file. This print was designed around it being printed on a Prusa Mini+ and Prusa i3 MK3S+.

> _**IMPORTANT:**_ It is never recommended to print from someone elses gcode files. Please use the STL files in your slicer of choice and generate the gcode on your own. Please let me know if you have any questions and thank you! Enjoy these prints!

> For staff_tip1 and staff_tip2 STL files you will need to chop them up in your slicer to fit on your bed. With the curvature or bend of these parts it may be difficult to have holes for wooden dowels. **If you need help with chopping these parts up, please create an issue in this repo and assign it to me. I will help you out as quickly as I can.** A glue I recommend is J-B Weld Plastic Bonder.
